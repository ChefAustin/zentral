# Zentral deployment

To help you evaluate Zentral, or kick-start your first production setup, we maintain 2 kinds of deployment:

* [Docker with docker-compose](./docker-compose) for local and simple deployments. We use it also internally for the Zentral development.
* `Zentral all in one` images on [AWS](./zaio-aws) and [Google Cloud](./zaio-gcp), which are great for testing Zentral with a small fleet of real machines.

## Support

We have different plans for custom support. Contact us via email, [Twitter](<https://twitter.com/zentral_io>) or on the **#macadmins** Slack channel â€“ subscribe [here](https://macadmins.herokuapp.com).

We build and support Zentral setups for business customers. Details are available on request.
